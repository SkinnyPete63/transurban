**The alignment point needs to be defined by taping the distance
betweenthe walls of the Tunnel entrance to identify the centre, then
taping from the pavement upto 1.5m above. The target needs to be this
point, taking into account that the laser beam would be generated
parallel to the centre of the photometer.
At the photometer, a laser level needs to be placed on top of the
photometer and the unit then needs to be adjusted until the beam hits
the target. The process must be repeated with the laser placed on each
side of the unit, meaning the adjustment on the target**

Hi John
I have had the operators investigate the damaged sign, there are several
instances where the sign went into fault;
1st, 14th, 22nd and 29th July reviewed available footage no associated
trucks sighted at the times of the faults.
8th July TSL in the tunnel with the EWP for works.
I suspect that the sign was damaged by a movable load, cattle that
raised its heads or similar.
In summary we are not able to determine the exact time of the damage.

Verbal, confirmation to go ahead and use XJS to repair the joint from
David Reeves to John De Luca, provided that XJS does not take longer to
implement then like for like repair. As XJS does not take longer, the
joint will be replaced with XJS.

Cc: Ivan Glavan; Lamb, Michael
Subject: RE: Power St expansion joint.
David, John,
I met with Ivan earlier this afternoon to discuss installation of XJS at
Power St to replace the existing damaged FIRMSEC joint. I suggested that
a check was needed to ensure that the range of the existing joint did
not preclude use of XJS at this location.  I have since confirmed that
the XJS would provide adequate range to replicate the existing joint.
Refer attached drawing and XJS spec which show:
EThe existing FIRMSECEFMS- D100 joint with nominal capacity of 100mm.
EIf we were to replace with the XJS, the maximum standard joint width
is 75mm with +100% / -50% movement range (+75mm / - 38mm = 113mm range).
Based on these observations we could:
1. Replace like-for-like using FIRMSEC or similar equivalent.
2. Replace existing joint with XJS with nominal 65mm joint width to
provide +65mm / -33mm = 98mm to give equivalent movement range to
existing.
I am of the opinion that 2. is preferable given issues to date with the
existing FIRMSEC and preference for TSL for XJS.  Both options are
proprietary systems and used widely.
I note also that creep and shrinkage 10-years post construction should
reduce the movement demand on the joint.
Also, observation of the joint at 3pm today at 15degC showed gap to be
60-70mm.  Assuming temperatures roughly consistent with this during
installation, the installed XJS gap width at 65mm would roughly match
that of the existing joint.
For your consideration.  Perhaps give me a call if you have any
questions.

Karsten,
Please make a recommendation as to the viability of XJS at Power St
following your discussion with Ivan on 4th August.
If you are able to provide information relevant to this change of joint
no later than the end of that day then TSL will be able to proceed down
this path.
John,
Please proceed with a normal repair on this joint this week should the
investigation process and further engineering on the use of XJS warrant

Extensometer and Piezometer Reading Procedures. Report
PSM500.R11 June 2001, R-SDG-TU-211.
4. Location:
Twenty-eight extensometers are located along the length of
the twin anchor zone of the tanked section of the Burnley
Tunnel, roughly in the centre of the middle lane.
5. Purpose:
The extensometers monitor any movement of the invert (floor)
slab.  Small variations in the extensometer tips can be
measured and assessed to indicate whether a slab has moved
and whether the twin anchors have become overloaded
(Ref. R-SDG-TU 130 Rev B) due to the slab movement.
6. Carry out Extensometer measurement.
6.1 (a) Clean the base of the extensometer probe with a clean
rag. (Note: Ensure extra battery is in pouch) prior to
performing readings.
(b) Plug the lead for the extensometer probe into readout
unit, switch the extensometer on using the right button,
select channel 1 with the knob.
(c) With the probe vertical and the base clear of any
obstructions, ensure the digital readout  reads approx.
11.5mm.  This represents the djusted zero value.
(d) Ensure the extensometer probe is kept free of grit at
all times.
6.2 (a) Locate the cast iron cover over the extensometer tip in
road surface.  Spray the bolts liberally with CRC.
(b) Using the socket, slowly and carefully remove the
stainless steel bolts.  If the bolt(s) are excessively
tight, apply more CRC and allow  sufficient time for the
CRC to penetrate down the thread.
(c) Lift the cast iron cap off and place to one side.
6.3 (a) Remove the plastic cap covering the brass bush and pin.
Do not loose the plastic cap.
(b) If the recess housing the bush or pin, contains water,
then remove the water using the wet/dry vacuum
(Ensure you take a Generator & leads).
Wipe the brass bush and pin surface areas are thoroughly
cleaned of all dirt and grit.
(c) Both the bush and pin must be clean and remain clean
during reading (i.e. no grit shall be allowed to wash
back onto the bush or pin surfaces).
6.4 (a) Place the extensometer probe over the brass pin and hold
the probe perpendicular to the surface of the bush
(i.e. generally  vertical).
(b) Apply a firm downwards pressure to the probe and allow
10 seconds for the reading to be established.
6.5 Record the readings on form MONTHLY BURNLEY TUNNEL - SLAB
MOVEMENT TMF-3012-OP-0259.  Compare with previous reading,
and if the difference is 0.2mm or more, check for
cleanliness of the extensometer surface and repeat the
reading.
6.6 (a) Replace the plastic cap, and cast iron cover.
(b) Apply grease to thread of the bolts, and screw the bolts
back into their holes using the socket, until they are a
snug tight fit.  Report in the Work Done area of Job
sheet any covers with bolts missing, Replace missing
bolts during inspection.
7. Repeat step 6 for each extensometer test point along the
tunnel.
8. Notify the Control room on completion of the Job.
9. Ensure a copy of the completed form MONTHLY BURNLEY TUNNEL -

Hi,
As per discussion over the phone with Davies we will arrange the works
for the upcoming closures (BT 20 September, DT 11 October) as the nature
of the locations would make it tricky to set up traffic management
outside closures e.g. onramp, VSLS locations etc.
Will confirm whether we are able to close the bridge to allow AECOM to
gain access to the top of the bridge also.

Hi Jason, Ivan,
AECOM have been tasked to conduct a visual inspection of Power St Bridge
elements (i.e. beams, bearings, movement joints and abutment back-walls)
to confirm the current structural condition and correlate this with the
observed movements from survey data collected over the years.
Please advise a suitable time to perform a detailed visual inspection of
the bridge and if theres any need to have boom lifts organized to allow
access. Also note the inspection would require close-up inspection of
the abutment back-walls and bearings.
We expect the best time is during the next tunnel closure (separated
into two inspections - Burnley and Domain side) or would it be possible
to work with partial lane closures at both abutment?

Subject: noise complaint near church st
John,
This relates to a noise complaint near church st.  I believe it is
existing issue with the height of the wall and therefore design issue
potentially.
I know it was ruled out last time but may be check again to determine
what the customer may be hearing.
Please report back on findings.  Text from customer below
The resolution at that time was that the noise would be improved by the
repair of the sound barrier as it had been damaged <(>&<)> was removed.
However after the repair, the noise still is an issue, albeit improved
slightly ( say 20% improvement). Normal traffic is OK when passing over
the one lane that has the expansion joints ( 2 sets prior to the bridge
City bound)...it is the large double trucks, particularly those carrying
fuel <(>&<)> livestock that make a loud thump/thump noise as they go
over the
expansion joints. I live in the large apartment block on Alexandra Ave/
Chapel St corner <(>&<)> the noise can be heard clearly with an
accompanying
vibration noticed by my dinner guests the other night ( hence this
communication). Is it possible to make the sound barriers taller to
contain the noise further?

Subject: Yarra River Crossing - Minor Tunnel Leak
Tony<(>,<)>
Thank you for letting me know about the leak including the attached
photograph and location (as below). The location is in the Yarra River
Crossing located on the south bank as illustrated on the attached
annotated as-builts. The tunnel lid is 9m below sea level.
As indicated on SC2-ST-2838, the water has passed vertically down
through:
·         Three water stops
·         Joint seal between planks at top
·         Joint seal between planks at bottom (this one as shown on your
photo is not the as-builts.
Alternatively the water may have entered through the wall horizontal
construction joint and entered the vertical construction joint.
Either way, the leak cannot be practically repaired as it has entered
somewhere through the outer wall/lid where access is not possible.
-------------------------------------
Warren,
My recommendation is to let this small leak to continue and keep an eye
on it. If the flow becomes significant then we ought to look further
into it. In the meantime, if dripping onto windscreens etc is of
concern, then we could look at controlling the route of the water to
make it inconspicuous.

pressure indicator at the same level as the piezometer
tip during the reading.
(d) Allow the reading to stabilise, and record reading on
form MONTHLY BURNLEY TUNNEL - GROUNDWATER PRESSURE
TMF-3012-OP-0229.
Note that some of  the readings may stabilise in a few
seconds, although some other readings may require a few
minutes to stabilise.
(e) Vent the Druck digital pressure indicator between
readings.
6.4 Record the results on form MONTHLY BURNLEY TUNNEL -
GROUNDWATER PRESSURE"""" TMF-3012-OP-0229.
6.5 Replace the stainless steel cover and re-tighten the bolt.

Subject: Bolte Bridge Aerofoil Inspection
Morning David
Starting on the 12 August 2014, G<(>&<)>G Engineering conducted an
inspection of the Bolte Bridge Aerofoil rivets, we had two teams working
along the Aerofoil to complete the inspection. Team 1 worked with the
Vic Roads underbridge unit to inspect the underside panels of the
aerofoil (bottom half of panel 3 and panels 4, 5 and 6) Team 2 worked
using a 45 foot boom lift inspected the top panels of the aerofoil
(panels 1, 2 and top half of panel 3) the bulk of the inspection was
conducted over 3 nights working from the road within a single slow lane
closure.
On this first night (12-8-2014) both teams started on the Outbound
(Northbound) Carriageway at the southernmost tip of the aerofoil, panel
segment number 5N-13.
Team 1 inspected up to the North expansion joint, panel segment number
1N, Team 2 inspected up to and including panel segment number 3NS21.
The second night (13-8-2014) both teams started on the Inbound
(Southbound) Carriageway, Team 1 started at the North expansion joint,
panel segment number 1S and inspected up to the southernmost end of the
aerofoil, panel segment number 5S-13.
Team 2 started at the northernmost tip of the aerofoil, panel segment
number 1S-13 and inspected up to and including panel segment number
3SN15.
With the majority of the underside completed at both outbound and
inbound a decision was made not to have the Vic Roads underbridge unit
return to complete the remaining 13 panels segments at the north end of
both inbound and outbound as these panels could be accessed via a boom
lift from ground level, ideally during the next expansion joint wing
inspection
The third night (14-8-2014) Team 2 along with an additional person
returned to the Outbound (Northbound) Carriageway and continued the
inspection of the top panels and completed to the last northernmost
panel segment 1N-13, by midnight traffic management was swapped over to
Inbound (Southbound) Carriageway and continued the inspection of the top
panels and completed to the last southernmost panel segment 5S-13.
Then on Thursday 21-8-2014 the underside of the remaining 13 panels
segments at the north end of both inbound and outbound aerofoil was
inspected using the truck mounted boom lift that was onsite providing
access to inspect the wing areas of the expansion joints.
A total of 306 rivets were replaced during these works. The outbound
aerofoil had a quantity of 181 rivets changed. The inbound aerofoil had
a quantity of 125 rivets changed.
Attached is a spreadsheet detailing the aerofoil panel segment numbers,
panel numbers and number of rivets replaced.

(panels 1, 2 and top half of panel 3) the bulk of the inspection was
conducted over 3 nights working from the road within a single slow lane
closure.
*
* On this first night (12-8-2014) both teams started on the Outbound
(Northbound) Carriageway at the southernmost tip of the aerofoil, panel
segment number 5N-13.
* Team 1 inspected up to the North expansion joint, panel segment number
1N, Team 2 inspected up to and including panel segment number 3NS21.
*
* The second night (13-8-2014) both teams started on the Inbound
(Southbound) Carriageway, Team 1 started at the North expansion joint,
panel segment number 1S and inspected up to the southernmost end of the
aerofoil, panel segment number 5S-13.
* Team 2 started at the northernmost tip of the aerofoil, panel segment
number 1S-13 and inspected up to and including panel segment number
3SN15.
*
* With the majority of the underside completed at both outbound and
inbound a decision was made not to have the Vic Roads underbridge unit
return to complete the remaining 13 panels segments at the north end of
both inbound and outbound as these panels could be accessed via a boom
lift from ground level, ideally during the next expansion joint wing
inspection
*
* The third night (14-8-2014) Team 2 along with an additional person
returned to the Outbound (Northbound) Carriageway and continued the
inspection of the top panels and completed to the last northernmost
panel segment 1N-13, by midnight traffic management was swapped over to
Inbound (Southbound) Carriageway and continued the inspection of the top
panels and completed to the last southernmost panel segment 5S-13.
*
* Then on Thursday 21-8-2014 the underside of the remaining 13 panels
segments at the north end of both inbound and outbound aerofoil was
inspected using the truck mounted boom lift that was onsite providing
access to inspect the wing areas of the expansion joints.
*
* A total of 306 rivets were replaced during these works. The outbound
aerofoil had a quantity of 181 rivets changed. The inbound aerofoil had
a quantity of 125 rivets changed.
*
* Attached is a spreadsheet detailing the aerofoil panel segment numbers,
panel numbers and number of rivets replaced.

mounted on the south side wall, and Forty-three mounted on
the north side wall.  They highest test point is located up
to 3.5m above the road surface on the tunnel walls.
5. Purpose:
The Piezometer test points are used to monitor groundwater
pressures on the outside of the tunnel wall.  The pressure
reading is then directly related to the groundwater head.
6. Carry out Piezometer readings:
6.1 (a) Loosen the bolt on one side of the stainless steel cover
and rotate the cover to reveal the quick connect
pressure coupling behind.
(b) Wipe the quick connect pressure coupling clean with a
rag.
(c) A ladder will be required to reach the piezometers in
the central section of the tunnel.  A second person may
be required to hold the ladder in place.
6.2 (a) Prior to each reading, Vent the Druck digital pressure
indicator using the tap on the hose of the machine to
allow the pressures within the instrument to equalise.
(b) Connect the Druck digital pressure indicator to the
quick connect coupling.  Pull back the sleeve on the
Druck digital pressure indicator connection and then
push the connection of the Druck digital pressure
indicator connection onto the piezometer connection.
6.3 (a) Press the  I/O button to switch the unit on.
(b) Ensure the reading is set to Kilopascals (kpa) and set
to zero.
(c) To obtain consistent readings, hold the Druck digital
pressure indicator at the same level as the piezometer
tip during the reading.
(d) Allow the reading to stabilise, and record reading on
form MONTHLY BURNLEY TUNNEL - GROUNDWATER PRESSURE
TMF-3012-OP-0229.
Note that some of  the readings may stabilise in a few
seconds, although some other readings may require a few
minutes to stabilise.
(e) Vent the Druck digital pressure indicator between
readings.
6.4 Record the results on form MONTHLY BURNLEY TUNNEL -
GROUNDWATER PRESSURE"""" TMF-3012-OP-0229.
6.5 Replace the stainless steel cover and re-tighten the bolt.

referenced in below email.
Hi Gihan/Jason,
As mentioned, Im acting as a bit of a go-between guy for some Customer
Sign works that have been ongoing the last couple of months.
The CML media team change over the vinyl screen on these four signs
around the network every few months to reflect different media
campaigns CityLink is promoting.
During the last swap over TSL completed some lighting tube replacements
on two of the signs, as a number of them are broken or inoperative. We
would like to continue doing this on the other two signs and address an
issue with the Western Link Outbound sign which seems to be off. Bill
helped me organise these works last time from memory so he might be a
bit clearer on the specifics (tube sizes etc.). Last time the Western
Link Inbound sign and the Southern Link Inbound sign were changed over,
this time all 4 will be.
At this stage Signwave are intending to complete the signage swap over
on the night of the 28th of July (Monday).
Im just waiting to hear back from Signwave regarding a contact to
liaise with on the night.
At this stage just wanted to give you  a heads up. I will provide more
details when they come to me.
Cheers,
Chris

**The alignment point needs to be defined by taping the distance
betweenthe walls of the Tunnel entrance to identify the centre, then
taping from the pavement upto 1.5m above. The target needs to be this
point, taking into account that the laser beam would be generated
parallel to the centre of the photometer.
At the photometer, a laser level needs to be placed on top of the
photometer and the unit then needs to be adjusted until the beam hits
the target. The process must be repeated with the laser placed on each

Subject: BT Smoke duct Bolt replacement - Progress report
David<(>,<)>
All completed bar one location; reference B489-N-B (formerly B26-N-2B).
This location requires installation of a new supplementary bolt and
removal of the existing bolt.  This location is impacted on by two drip
trays and deluge water pipes (braces and the pipe itself).
It was noted during this closure that in addition to the above that the
crossover pipe for the deluge system actually sits approximately 40-50mm
higher than the gantries the platform is being installed on.  Long story
short, G<(>&<)>G Engineering are coming up with a way to engineer
spacers for the platform so that it sits above the crossover pipe.
G<(>&<)>G are aware of this issue.
