AU02192 	******************************************************
AU02192 	Recommendations for inspection and testing of the smoke
AU02192 	duct anchor bolts
AU02192 	There are two particular circumstances that suggest that the anchors
AU02192 	supporting the smoke duct should be
AU02192 	subject to testing and inspection at a higher level than for general
AU02192 	civil engineering construction:
AU02192 	1. The anchors are critical to keeping the precast concrete segments of
AU02192 	"the smoke duct in place, and if one"
AU02192 	"of these segments fell, the consequences would be very severe."
AU02192 	2. The anchors are drilled-in to the concrete tunnel lining which has
AU02192 	developed cracking over the time since
AU02192 	construction. If a crack in the tunnel lining passes through an anchor
AU02192 	"bolt hole, it will reduce the load"
AU02192 	carrying capacity of the anchor.
AU02192 	"With these circumstances in mind, the following inspection and testing"
AU02192 	program is recommended:
AU02192 	Every five years undertake a visual inspection of the exposed end of
AU02192 	every anchor bolt that supports the smoke
AU02192 	duct. Check the following (responses indicating no defects are shown in
AU02192 	brackets):
AU02192 	1. Is there any corrosion of the anchor bolt assembly? (NO)
AU02192 	2. Are the nut and anchor bolt tight (check for finger tight only)?
AU02192 	(YES)
AU02192 	3. Is there at least one full thread exposed beyond the nut? (YES)
AU02192 	4. Is there any cracking in the tunnel concrete lining that appears to
AU02192 	pass through the anchor bolt hole?
AU02192 	(NO)
AU02192 	5. Is there any evidence of movement (since construction) in the gap
AU02192 	between the precast segment of the
AU02192 	smoke duct and the tunnel concrete lining? (NO)
AU02192 	"In addition to checking these five points, it is necessary to check the"
AU02192 	length of embedment of the anchor bolt. To
AU02192 	"do this, measure the gap between the precast segment of the smoke duct"
AU02192 	"and the tunnel concrete lining, and add"
AU02192 	to this distance the length of anchor bolt that is exposed beyond the
AU02192 	nut. The sum of the two
AU02192 	lengths should be no more than 60mm.
AU02192 	If the visual inspection indicates that the bolt installation may be
AU02192 	"defective, take photographs of the defect for"
AU02192 	"review and assessment of remedial measures. If defects are found, the"
AU02192 	inspection frequency will need to be
AU02192 	reviewed.

AU02220 	3. Apparatus required:
AU02220 	   a. CML's - WG OMK-6 Optical test Kit - Optical Power Meter
AU02220 	      set at 850nm.
AU02220 	   b. CML's - Tektronix TDS-3012 Digital Oscilloscope and
AU02220 	      isolation transformer - including appropriate test leads
AU02220 	"      and a BNC ""T"" junction."
AU02220 	   c. Transfield's - Sound Meter
AU02220 	"   d. RRB-PA / CCCS - 1KHz test tone message = ""ZZ_1_KHz_Tone"
AU02220 	"      (137)""."

AU02220 	    WARNING: THE LIGHT EMITTED FROM A FIBRE OPTIC CABLE MAY BE
AU02220 	"    EITHER VISIBLE OR INVISIBLE, DIRECTING THE FIBRE OPTIC CABLE"
AU02220 	    TOWARDS THE EYE OR LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THE END OF A FIBRE
AU02220 	"    OPTIC CABLE WHICH IS EMITTING LIGHT, WILL CAUSE IRREVERSABLE"
AU02220 	    DAMAGE TO THE EYE.
AU02220 	4. The following needs to be performed at each Tunnel TOA PA
AU02220 	"   Amplifier, which are located in the Tunnel Equipment Rooms."
AU02220 	5. Measure and record the fibre received signal level. This can
AU02220 	   be done by disconnecting the multimode fibre from the OSD363
AU02220 	   fibre receiver and connecting it into the Optical Power Meter
AU02220 	   set at 850nm. Record the dB level and then connect the fibre
AU02220 	   back into the OSD363 fibre receiver. The level is expected to
AU02220 	"   be between -18 to -30 dB, dependant on the distance of the"
AU02220 	   Equipment Room from Technical Shelter 8. Levels greater than
AU02220 	   -40dB indicate a possible fibre fault and should be
AU02220 	   investigated before proceeding.
AU02220 	6. Measure and record the 20KHz tone audio level between the
AU02220 	   OSD363 Fibre receiver and the TOA PA Amplifier. This can be
AU02220 	"   done by connecting a BNC ""T"" connector inline between the"
AU02220 	   OSD363 Fibre receiver and the TOA PA Amplifier and then
AU02220 	   connect the Digital Oscilloscope. Record the signal level in
AU02220 	   milivolts. The level is expected to be 500mV P-P (peak to
AU02220 	   peak).
AU02220 	   Before making any adjustment to the output level of the
AU02220 	"   OSD363, move the slider controls for the PA Amplifier Pre-Amp"
AU02220 	   and Master Volume down to 1. It may be possible to adjust the
AU02220 	   output level of the OSD363 Fibre receiver to produce the
AU02220 	"   expected output. Remove the BNC ""T"" connector and reconnect"
AU02220 	   the OSD363 directly to the TOA PA Amplifier.
AU02220 	7. Adjust the PA Amplifier sliders to produce two green bars on
AU02220 	   the PA Amplifier signal level indicator. Set the Pre-Amp
AU02220 	"   Control (V-1054B) to 8, and then adjust up the Master Volume"
AU02220 	   Control to obtain the two bars of level indication. The
AU02220 	"   Master level is generally 2 to 4 below the Pre-Amp level, if"
AU02220 	"   Pre-Amp is 8, the Master is expected to be between 4 to 6."
AU02220 	"8. Request the TCR, from the CCCS, play a normal"
AU02220 	"   message into the Tunnel, for example ""Left Lane Closed"", like"
AU02220 	"   for the Domain Tunnel = ""DT : Left Lane - D28 Maintenance"
AU02220 	"   (79)"""
AU02220 	"   for the Burnley Tunnel = ""BT : Left Lane - D59 Maintenance"
AU02220 	"   (155)"""
AU02220 	   Request that it ONLY be played to the Tunnel PA System.
AU02220 	9. The next test is performed in the Tunnel using the Transfield
AU02220 	   Sound Meter.
AU02220 	   WARNING: Hearing Protection must be worn during the following
AU02220 	   test.
AU02220 	   Position the sound meter in the centre of the centre running
AU02220 	"   lane, 1500mm above the roadway. Request the TCR, from the"
AU02220 	   CCCS play for 4 to 5 seconds the 1KHz test tone name
AU02220 	"   ""ZZ_1_KHz_Tone (137)"" ONLY to the Tunnel PA and"
AU02220 	   preferably only the zone being tested. Measure and record the
AU02220 	   result on form TMF-3012-OP-0391. The expected level is 94
AU02220 	   dB(A).
AU02220 	10.Repeat the above test for each of the Tunnel PA Zones.
AU02220 	"11.On completion of the job, record anything outside normal"
AU02220 	"   parameters in the """"Work Done"""" area of the job sheet. Raise"
AU02220 	   a new job sheet for any works that require further attention.
