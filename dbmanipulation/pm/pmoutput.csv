    DAMAGE TO THE EYE.
4. The following needs to be performed at each Tunnel TOA PA
   Amplifier, which are located in the Tunnel Equipment Rooms.
5. Measure and record the fibre received signal level. This can
   be done by disconnecting the multimode fibre from the OSD363
   fibre receiver and connecting it into the Optical Power Meter
   set at 850nm. Record the dB level and then connect the fibre
   back into the OSD363 fibre receiver. The level is expected to
   be between -18 to -30 dB, dependant on the distance of the
   Equipment Room from Technical Shelter 8. Levels greater than
   -40dB indicate a possible fibre fault and should be
   investigated before proceeding.
6. Measure and record the 20KHz tone audio level between the
   OSD363 Fibre receiver and the TOA PA Amplifier. This can be
   done by connecting a BNC ""T"" connector inline between the
   OSD363 Fibre receiver and the TOA PA Amplifier and then
   connect the Digital Oscilloscope. Record the signal level in
   milivolts. The level is expected to be 500mV P-P (peak to
   peak).
   Before making any adjustment to the output level of the
   OSD363, move the slider controls for the PA Amplifier Pre-Amp
   and Master Volume down to 1. It may be possible to adjust the
   output level of the OSD363 Fibre receiver to produce the
   expected output. Remove the BNC ""T"" connector and reconnect
   the OSD363 directly to the TOA PA Amplifier.
7. Adjust the PA Amplifier sliders to produce two green bars on
   the PA Amplifier signal level indicator. Set the Pre-Amp
   Control (V-1054B) to 8, and then adjust up the Master Volume
   Control to obtain the two bars of level indication. The
   Master level is generally 2 to 4 below the Pre-Amp level, if
   Pre-Amp is 8, the Master is expected to be between 4 to 6.
8. Request the TCR, from the CCCS, play a normal
   message into the Tunnel, for example ""Left Lane Closed"", like

   for the Domain Tunnel = ""DT : Left Lane - D28 Maintenance
   (79)""
   for the Burnley Tunnel = ""BT : Left Lane - D59 Maintenance
   (155)""
   Request that it ONLY be played to the Tunnel PA System.
9. The next test is performed in the Tunnel using the Transfield
   Sound Meter.
   WARNING: Hearing Protection must be worn during the following
   test.
   Position the sound meter in the centre of the centre running
   lane, 1500mm above the roadway. Request the TCR, from the
   CCCS play for 4 to 5 seconds the 1KHz test tone name
   ""ZZ_1_KHz_Tone (137)"" ONLY to the Tunnel PA and

          operates for each of the carriers on form TMF-3012-OP-0108.
 Operation of the carrier
          squelch is indicated by an orange LED on the receiver front
panel.
6.3     Off-air Receiver Tests.
          The operation of each Off-air base station receiver will be
confirmed by injecting a test
          signal into the Off-air input receive filter.  The UHF
repeater downlink will be removed
          from service during this test by disconnecting the antenna
from the RX input filter.
         The operation of the receiver can be confirmed by observing
thereceiver carrier front
         panel orange RX squelch LED.
    (a) Connect the IFR radio test set to the input RX filter and set
the IFR carrier level to
          -80dbm.
          Inject test carriers at the frequencies shown on  form
TMF-3012-OP-0108.  Record the
          result for each of the carriers.
          Return the UHF downlink to service by reconnecting the
antennato the RX input
          filter   [_ _].
6.4     Downlink RF Level Tests
          The operation of the downlink is verified by measuring the
101.1 Mhz FM station level
          at each equipment room.  Measurements are made at the
equipment downlink amplifier
          VHF monitor test point.
    (a) Connect the spectrum analyser to the monitor point.  Measure at
each equipment room
          and record the 101.1 Mhz carrier level.
6.5     Uplink RF Level Tests.
          The operation of the Uplink is verified by injecting a test
signal at each equipment and
          measuring the level at the Grant Street patch panel uplink
monitor point.
   (a)  Set the RF signal generator to 450 Mhz -20dBm Carrier
unmodulated.
          At each of the equipment rooms,  connect the RF signal
generator into either of the
          uplink combiner inputs.  Measure the level at the Grant
StreetTSH 08 patch panel
          A5 - A11 and record the result on form TMF-3012-OP-0108.
7. On completion of the job, record anything outside normal parameters
in the """"Work Done""""
    area of the job sheet.  Raise a new job sheet for any works that
require further attention.
    Job priority = P1 High priority.
8. Notify the control room on completion of the inspection.

6. Check the general alignment of the Photometer for accuracy.

Methodology for Alignment Check:

**The alignment point needs to be defined by taping the distance
betweenthe walls of the Tunnel entrance to identify the centre, then
taping from the pavement upto 1.5m above. The target needs to be
this point, taking into account that the laser beam would be generated
parallel to the centre of the photometer.

At the photometer, a laser level needs to be placed on top of the
photometer and the unit then needs to be adjusted until the beam hits
the target. The process must be repeated with the laser placed on each
side of the unit, meaning the adjustment on the target**
