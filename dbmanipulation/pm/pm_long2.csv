The following needs to be performed at each Tunnel TOA PA<br />   Amplifier, which are located in the Tunnel Equipment Rooms.<br />5. Measure and record the fibre received signal level. This can<br />   be done by disconnecting the multimode fibre from the OSD363<br />   fibre receiver and connecting it into the Optical Power Meter<br />   set at 850nm. Record the dB level and then connect the fibre<br />   back into the OSD363 fibre receiver. The level is expected to<br />   be between -18 to -30 dB, dependant on the distance of the<br />   Equipment Room from Technical Shelter 8. Levels greater than<br />   -40dB indicate a possible fibre fault and should be<br />   investigated before proceeding.<br />6. Measure and record the 20KHz tone audio level between the<br />   OSD363 Fibre receiver and the TOA PA Amplifier. This can be<br />   done by connecting a BNC ""T"" connector inline between the<br />   OSD363 Fibre receiver and the TOA PA Amplifier and then<br />   connect the Digital Oscilloscope. Record the signal level in<br />   milivolts. The level is expected to be 500mV P-P (peak to<br />   peak).<br />   Before making any adjustment to the output level of the<br />   OSD363, move the slider controls for the PA Amplifier Pre-Amp<br />   and Master Volume down to 1. It may be possible to adjust the<br />   output level of the OSD363 Fibre receiver to produce the<br />   expected output. Remove the BNC ""T"" connector and reconnect<br />   the OSD363 directly to the TOA PA Amplifier.<br />7. Adjust the PA Amplifier sliders to produce two green bars on<br />   the PA Amplifier signal level indicator. Set the Pre-Amp<br />   Control (V-1054B) to 8, and then adjust up the Master Volume<br />   Control to obtain the two bars of level indication. The<br />   Master level is generally 2 to 4 below the Pre-Amp level, if<br />   Pre-Amp is 8, the Master is expected to be between 4 to 6.<br />8. Request the TCR, from the CCCS, play a normal<br />   message into the Tunnel, for example ""Left Lane Closed"", like<br />   for the Domain Tunnel = ""DT : Left Lane - D28 Maintenance<br />   (79)""<br />   for the Burnley Tunnel = ""BT : Left Lane - D59 Maintenance<br />   (155)""<br />   Request that it ONLY be played to the Tunnel PA System.<br />9.

This work is to be carried out by a sub-contractor, all<br />   necessary Work Permits and HSE documentation to be submitted<br />   prior to commencement of work.<br />3. Inspect the bolts anchoring the smoke duct and the jet fans<br />   throughout the Tunnel as set out in INTICO leter dated<br />   8 September 2004 and Visual Inspection Report  01135_VT.001A<br />   dated 19-07-2004.<br />4. Submit report following completion of the works.<br />******************************************************<br />Recommendations for inspection and testing of the smoke<br />duct anchor bolts<br />There are two particular circumstances that suggest that the anchors<br />supporting the smoke duct should be<br />subject to testing and inspection at a higher level than for general<br />civil engineering construction:<br />1. The anchors are critical to keeping the precast concrete segments of<br />the smoke duct in place, and if one<br />of these segments fell, the consequences would be very severe.<br />2. The anchors are drilled-in to the concrete tunnel lining which has<br />developed cracking over the time since<br />construction. If a crack in the tunnel lining passes through an anchor<br />bolt hole, it will reduce the load<br />carrying capacity of the anchor.<br />With these circumstances in mind, the following inspection and testing<br />program is recommended:<br />Every five years undertake a visual inspection of the exposed end of<br />every anchor bolt that supports the smoke<br />duct. Check the following (responses indicating no defects are shown in<br />brackets):<br />1. Is there any corrosion of the anchor bolt assembly? (NO)<br />2. Are the nut and anchor bolt tight (check for finger tight only)?<br />(YES)<br />3. Is there at least one full thread exposed beyond the nut? (YES)<br />4. Is there any cracking in the tunnel concrete lining that appears to<br />pass through the anchor bolt hole?<br />(NO)<br />5. Is there any evidence of movement (since construction) in the gap<br />between the precast segment of the<br />smoke duct and the tunnel concrete lining? (NO)<br />In addition to checking these five points, it is necessary to check the<br />length of embedment of the anchor bolt. To<br />do this, measure the gap between the precast segment of the smoke duct<br />and the tunnel concrete lining, and add<br />to this distance the length of anchor bolt that is exposed beyond the<br />nut. The sum of the two<br />lengths should be no more than 60mm.<br />If the visual inspection indicates that the bolt installation may be<br />defective, take photographs of the defect for<br />review and assessment of remedial measures. If defects are found, the<br />inspection frequency will need to be<br />reviewed.<br />For further details of inspections refer<br />G:\TFM\Operations\Structures Level 2 Inspections\Smoke Duct Anchor<br />bolts- Recommendation fo inspection & Testing (Diagram in Page 3, 10<br />February 2010)<br />"
